python -m venv .venv
```
3. Install all dependency
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Run the script
```
python main.py

If you don't have python or lazy to setup the environment, you can go to [release](https://github.com/ts0ra/XAG/releases) page and download compiled binary of this script.
